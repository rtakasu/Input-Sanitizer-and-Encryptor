Executable: ./rgt2108.2

The program can either read files with commands as a series of command line arguments or you can run the program with no command line arguments and input the commands through stdin. 

The commands are read into the program and the program tests if the commands are of a valid length and format. Once the program has identified a valid command, it executes the appropriate command for the instruction. The possible commands are "encrypt <input file> <output file>, decrypt <input file> <output file>, password <password> <keyfile>, and keyfile <keyfile>.
